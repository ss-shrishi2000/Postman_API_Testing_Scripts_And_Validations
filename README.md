### Testing API Headers:

1. There is a lot of information present in the Headers section but our testing should be testing the "Content-Type".
2. Majorily, what does the "Content-Type" section represent: Response Format => JSON, XML, HTML, etc. The format can be (let's say): application/json;  which is termed as "mime type". Type of response/data is called as mime-type.
3. So, we need to verify if the content type is in JSON Format or not.
4. We can also perform validation on "Connection" field.
5. We can also perform validation on "Expires" field.
